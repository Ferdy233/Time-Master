# Time-Master
Challenges:

1. Time Object Basics:
• Task: Create a JavaScript Date object to represent the current time.
• Evaluation:
o Code Review: Ensure proper use of the Date constructor and methods 
like getHours(), getMinutes(), and getSeconds().
o Output Test: Verify the ability to extract and log the current hour, 
minute, and second.

2. Object-Oriented Clock:
• Task: Design a Clock object with properties like hours, minutes, and seconds.
• Evaluation:
o Code Review: Assess the correct use of properties and potential use of 
a constructor function for clock creation.
o Output Test: Confirm the ability to create clock instances and access 
their properties.

3. Time Formatting:
• Task: Add methods to the Clock object for formatting time:
o getFormattedTime(): Returns a string in the format “HH:MM:SS”.
o get12HourTime(): Returns a string with AM/PM.
• Evaluation:
o Code Review: Check for accurate time formatting logic within the 
methods.
o Output Test: Verify that formatted time strings are produced correctly.

4. Dynamic Display:
• Task: Create a function to display the clock on a webpage (e.g., using a div 
element).
• Evaluation:
o Code Review: Assess the use of DOM manipulation to update the clock 
display.
o Output Test: Confirm that the clock display updates every second with 
the correct time.

5. Clock Customization:
• Task: Add options to customize the clock (e.g., 12/24-hour format, time zone, 
colors).
• Evaluation:
o Code Review: Evaluate the implementation of customization options 
within the Clock object.
o Output Test: Verify that customization options affect the clock display 
as expected.

6. Advanced Challenge (Optional):
• Task: Build an alarm clock feature that triggers an alert at a specified time.
• Evaluation:
o Functionality: Assess the alarm's ability to trigger at the correct time 
and the user's ability to set the alarm.
o Code Review: Evaluate the code for the alarm functionality, including 
time comparison and alert mechanisms.
